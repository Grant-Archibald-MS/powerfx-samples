# Overview

This sample demonstrates use of Power Fx of [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). The Language Server Protocol (LSP) defines the protocol used between an editor or IDE and a language server that provides language features like AutoComplete.

The [Microsoft.PowerFx.LanguageServerProtocol](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PowerFx.LanguageServerProtocol/) provides an implementation of the Language Server Protocol for Power Fx. 

## Getting Started

To run the server example that will print response of jsonrpc to the console

1. Compile the sample

```bash
cd server
dotnet build
```

2. Run the sample

```
dotnet run
```

## Functionality 

### Auto Complete

Auto Complete for the Power Fx language service is provided by calling [Engine.Suggest](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.powerfx.engine.suggest?view=powerfx-sdk-latest) which expects a position in the Power Fx expression at which to provide the suggestion. The results of the suggestions are returned in response to "textDocument/completion" request.

## Understanding the Language Server Protocol (LSP)

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a standardized protocol used to enable communication between an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and a language server. This protocol allows developers to enhance their coding experience with features like code completion, hover information, diagnostics, and more. Below are key concepts of LSP:

### Key Concepts

#### Initialize

The `initialize` method establishes the initial connection between the language server and the IDE. It serves two main purposes:
1. Allows the language server to announce its capabilities.
2. Informs the IDE about the supported features, such as code completion, diagnostics, and formatting.

#### Text Document Sync

The synchronization of text documents is handled by three key methods:
- `textDocument/didOpen`
- `textDocument/didChange`
- `textDocument/didClose`

These methods ensure that the language server receives updated information about the source code, which enables it to provide accurate and real-time feedback to the developer.

#### Hover

The `textDocument/hover` method enables the IDE to request additional information about a specific code element. This may include:
- Function signatures
- Variable types
- Documentation comments

This method enhances code comprehension and helps developers understand unfamiliar codebases more effectively.

#### Completion

The `textDocument/completion` method allows the IDE to retrieve a list of completion suggestions based on the current code context. These suggestions can include:
- Relevant keywords
- Function names
- Variable names

This feature reduces the need for manual code typing and speeds up the development process.

#### Diagnostics

The `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` method is used by the language server to provide real-time feedback to the IDE. It includes information about:
- Syntax errors
- Warnings
- Code quality issues

IDEs can then display these diagnostics to the developer, aiding in bug prevention and enhancing code reliability.
